# Ansible + Steampipe

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is an open-source zero-ETL engine to instantly query cloud APIs using SQL.

[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) offers open-source automation that is simple, flexible, and powerful.

The QBO plugin makes it simpler to query the configured QuickBooks Online account.

Get information about the Quickbooks Online company:

```sql
select
  id,
  company_name
from
  qbo_company_info;
```

```
+----+--------------+
| id | company_name | 
+----+--------------+
| 1  | Cloudticity  |

```
